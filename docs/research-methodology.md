# Research Methodology

Visible Systems supports empirical research at the intersection of systems programming and computing education.

---

## Research Goals

- Study how observability affects learning
- Evaluate performance reasoning in C++
- Bridge educational practice and systems research

---

## Methodological Approach

### Empirical Focus
Research should be:
- Data-driven
- Reproducible
- Transparent

### Mixed Methods
Both quantitative and qualitative methods are encouraged, including:
- Controlled experiments
- Benchmark analysis
- Written reasoning analysis

---

## Reproducibility

All studies should:
- Document experimental setup
- Provide code and data where possible
- Describe limitations clearly

---

## Human Subjects

Research involving learners must:
- Obtain informed consent
- Minimise risk
- Follow institutional ethics approval processes

---

## Reporting

Publications should:
- Clearly state research questions
- Describe methodology in sufficient detail
- Discuss threats to validity

These practices align with SIGCSE and ACM expectations.
