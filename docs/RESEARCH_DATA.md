# Research Data Guidelines

Visible Systems supports empirical research in systems programming and computing education. All research data associated with this project must follow principles of transparency, reproducibility, and ethical responsibility.

---

## Data Types

Research data may include:
- Benchmark results (CSV, JSON)
- Experimental configurations
- Anonymised participant responses
- Derived metrics and summaries

No personally identifiable information (PII) should be collected or stored.

---

## Data Collection

- Data must be collected using documented, reproducible procedures
- Experimental parameters (compiler, build type, hardware notes) must be recorded
- Benchmarks should be deterministic where feasible

When human participants are involved, data collection must comply with institutional ethics requirements.

---

## Anonymisation & Privacy

- Participant identities must not be recorded
- Free-text responses must be reviewed to remove identifying information
- Data should be aggregated before publication

---

## Storage & Access

- Research datasets should be stored in clearly labelled directories
- Raw and processed data should be separated
- Any data exclusions or transformations must be documented

---

## Sharing & Reuse

Datasets intended for publication should:
- Be clearly described
- Include a README explaining structure and context
- Specify licensing and citation requirements

Where possible, datasets should be shared openly to support replication.
