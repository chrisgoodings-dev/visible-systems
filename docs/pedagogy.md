# Pedagogical Philosophy

Visible Systems is grounded in the belief that systems programming concepts are difficult to learn primarily because their effects are hidden.

This project is designed to support **honest, observable, and inquiry-driven learning**.

## Core Principles

### 1. Make Behaviour Observable
Learners should be able to measure and see system effects such as:
- Memory layout
- Cache behaviour
- Performance variation

### 2. Prefer Experiments Over Explanation
Understanding emerges through:
- Prediction
- Measurement
- Reflection

### 3. Avoid Misleading Abstractions
Abstractions should clarify, not obscure, real system behaviour.

### 4. Support Diverse Learners
Material should be accessible to:
- Students new to systems
- Practicing engineers
- Educators

---

## Intended Use

Visible Systems labs are suitable for:
- Undergraduate systems courses
- Performance modules
- Independent study
- Research-informed teaching

---

## Learning Outcomes

Learners using this material should develop:
- Accurate mental models of system behaviour
- Confidence in performance reasoning
- A habit of measurement-based thinking
