# Project Overview

Visible Systems is an open-source project focused on making low-level system behaviour observable for learners, educators, and researchers.

---

## Motivation

Key system behaviours—memory access, caching, concurrency—are critical to software performance and correctness, yet are often invisible in source code.

This invisibility creates barriers to learning and leads to fragile mental models.

## What This Project Provides

- Small, focused C++ labs
- Instrumented benchmarks
- Teaching materials
- Research-ready experimental infrastructure

---

## Who This Is For

- Students learning systems programming
- Educators teaching performance or memory
- Engineers seeking deeper intuition
- Researchers studying systems education

---

## Project Structure

- `labs/` — experimental code
- `docs/` — pedagogy and methodology
- `teaching/` — worksheets and exercises
- `tools/` — analysis and plotting scripts

---

## Vision

By making systems visible, we aim to make systems programming:
- More understandable
- More teachable
- More inclusive
