# Authorship & Contribution Guidelines

Visible Systems follows established academic norms for authorship, consistent with ACM and SIGCSE expectations.

---

## Authorship Criteria

Authorship is appropriate for contributors who have made **substantial intellectual contributions**, including one or more of:

- Research design or methodology
- Development of core experimental infrastructure
- Data analysis or interpretation
- Writing or substantial revision of research manuscripts

Routine contributions (e.g. minor bug fixes) do not normally warrant authorship but will be acknowledged.

---

## Student Contributions

Student contributors may qualify for authorship when their work:
- Contributes directly to research outcomes
- Involves independent intellectual input
- Is integrated into a publication

Supervisory or mentoring relationships must be transparent.

---

## Order of Authors

Author order should reflect:
- Level of intellectual contribution
- Discipline norms (typically contribution-based ordering)

The corresponding author is responsible for coordination and submission.

---

## Acknowledgements

Contributors who do not meet authorship criteria should be acknowledged in publications.

---

## Disputes

Authorship discussions should occur early.  
In the event of disputes, the project maintainer will seek a fair resolution consistent with academic norms.
