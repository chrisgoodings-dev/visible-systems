## Contribution Principles

Please keep the following goals in mind:

- **Make system behaviour observable**  
  Avoid hiding important effects behind abstractions.

- **Prefer clarity over cleverness**  
  Code should be readable by learners.

- **Support reproducibility**  
  Experiments should be deterministic where possible and clearly documented.

- **Teach honestly**  
  Avoid oversimplifications that misrepresent real system behaviour.
